        <p><strong>Electricity</strong> is a form of energy and it occurs in nature, so it was not “invented.” As to who
            discovered it,
            many misconceptions abound. Some give credit to <b> Benjamin Franklin </b>for discovering electricity, but
            his
            experiments only helped establish the connection between lightning and electricity, nothing more.

        <p>The truth about the discovery of electricity is a bit more complex <span class="fst-italic">than a man flying
                his kite</span>. It actually goes back more than two thousand years.</p>

        <p>In about<mark> 600 BC</mark>, the Ancient Greeks discovered that rubbing fur on amber (fossilized tree resin)
            caused an
            attraction between the two – and so what the Greeks discovered was actually <strong>static</strong>
            electricity.
            Additionally, researchers and archeologists in the<mark> 1930’s</mark> discovered pots with sheets of copper
            inside that
            they believe may have been ancient batteries meant to produce light at<span class="fst-italic"> ancient
                Roman sites</span>. Similar
            devices
            were found in archeological digs near Baghdad meaning ancient Persians may have also used an early form of
            batteries <br> But by the<mark> 17th century</mark>, many electricity-related discoveries had been made,
            such as the
            invention of an early electrostatic generator, the differentiation between positive and negative currents,
            and the classification of materials as conductors or insulators.</p>
        <p>In the year<mark> 1600</mark>, English physician <strong>William Gilbert</strong> used the Latin word
            <mark>“electricus”</mark> to describe the force
            that certain substances exert when rubbed against each other. A few years later another English scientist,
            <strong>Thomas Browne</strong>, wrote several books and he used the word “electricity” to describe his
            investigations based
            on Gilbert’s work.</p>
        <p><mark>In 1752</mark>, Ben Franklin conducted his experiment with a kite, a key, and a storm. This simply
            proved that
            lightning and tiny electric sparks were the same thing.</p>
        <p>Italian physicist <strong> Alessandro Volta</strong> discovered that particular chemical reactions could
            produce electricity,
            and in<mark> 1800</mark> he constructed the voltaic pile (an early electric battery) that produced a steady
            electric
            current, and so he was the first person to create a steady flow of electrical charge. <span
                class="fst-italic">Volta also created
                the
                first transmission of electricity by linking positively-charged and negatively-charged connectors and
                driving an electrical charge, or voltage, through them.</span></p>
        <p><mark>In 1831</mark> electricity became viable for use in technology when <strong> Michael Faraday</strong>
            created the electric dynamo (a
            crude power generator), which solved the problem of generating electric current in an ongoing and practical
            way. Faraday’s rather crude invention used a magnet that was moved inside a coil of copper wire, creating a
            tiny electric current that flowed through the wire. This opened the door to American<strong> Thomas
                Edison</strong> and
            British scientist<strong> Joseph Swan</strong> who each invented the incandescent filament light bulb in
            their respective
            countries in about<mark> 1878</mark>. Previously, light bulbs had been invented by others, but the
            incandescent bulb was
            the first practical bulb that would light for hours on end.</p>
        <p>Later in the<mark> 1800’s</mark> and<mark> early 1900’s</mark> Serbian American engineer, inventor, and all
            around electrical wizard
            <strong> Nikola Tesla</strong> became an important contributor to the birth of commercial electricity. He
            worked with Edison
            and later had many revolutionary developments in electromagnetism, and had competing patents with<strong>
                Marconi</strong>
            for the invention of radio. He is well known for his work with alternating current (AC), AC motors, and the
            polyphase distribution system.</p>
