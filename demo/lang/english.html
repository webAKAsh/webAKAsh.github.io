ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS (Q.501) … (Interruptions) SHRI J.C. DIVAKAR REDDY:
Madam Speaker, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. …
(Interruptions) The entire august House will agree with me that under the
dynamic leadership of our hon. Prime Minister the dream of ‘Make in India’ and
the objective of our hon. Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh – who always strives
to realize the dream of ‘Make in Andhra’ – I hope, the National Industrial and
Manufacturing Zones (NIMZs) will, no doubt, be successful in future.…
(Interruptions) The National Manufacturing Policy contains dispensations to
facilitate manufacturing industry in National Investment and Manufacturing Zones
and the manufacturing industry in the country as a whole, including enabling the
manufacturing units to organise themselves into clusters. … (Interruptions)For
the financial year 2016-17, Rs. 3.35 crore has been earmarked under the Scheme
for Implementation of National Manufacturing Policy, Master Planning of NIMZs
and Technology Acquisition and Development Fund. … (Interruptions) My first
supplementary question to the hon. Minister, through you, Madam Speaker is this.
When would these NIMZs see the light of day? As you know Anantapur is part of
the proposed Bengaluru-Kurnool Industrial Corridor and CBIC, that is,
Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial corridor. Is there any proposal to include
Anantapur in the NIMZs? Has any action plan or time frame been fixed for
complete implementation of these 22 NIMZs? … (Interruptions) SHRIMATI NIRMALA
SITHARAMAN: Madam Speaker, the hon. Member has asked questions about Anantapur
District. … (Interruptions) As it is, we are aware that eight zones under the
Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor are being covered and 14 others, which are
outside the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, are dedicated as zones, but there
is no new proposal to include a particular district, such as the Member has
supported Anantapur. That or others have not been newly added on to the list. …
(Interruptions) SHRI J.C. DIVAKAR REDDY: Madam, Anantapur is a backward
district. It is by the side of Bengaluru and nearer to Bengaluru. So, the hon.
Minister has to be concerned about the development of Anantapur. …
(Interruptions) I would request her to propose one more zone there so that there
is an opportunity available to set up industries like textile and agriculture.
So, it is my special request to the hon. Minister to try and include Anantapur.
… (Interruptions) ) HON. SPEAKER: I am sorry. … (Interruptions) HON. SPEAKER:
The House stands adjourned to meet again at 11.20 a.m. The Lok Sabha then
adjourned till Twenty Minutes past Eleven of the Clock. ORAL ANSWERS TO
QUESTIONS .... Contd. SHRI J.C. DIVAKAR REDDY: Madam, the respected Minister
knows Anantapur very well. … (Interruptions) HON. SPEAKER: No, I am not allowing
anybody. … (Interruptions) SHRI J.C. DIVAKAR REDDY: Anantapur is a backward
area. It is worse than Jaisalmer District in Rajasthan as industrially and
agriculture-wise we are very poor and many people are migrating from there. HON.
SPEAKER: What is your Question? SHRI J.C. DIVAKAR REDDY: Yes, Madam, I am asking
it. They are migrating to Bangalore, Chennai and other places. Day by day, the
problem of people migrating from there is increasing, but at the same time we
are having a lot of waste land and good land there. My request is only this,
through you, to our hon. Minister. She has recognized Prakasam and Chittoor
Districts and two Centres she has given there. My request is that my District is
worse than all these Districts. Why do not you give one more Centre for us? The
Government will not lose anything whereas it will give a scope for us to develop
economically and financially. Please consider my District for it. SHRIMATI
NIRMALA SITHARAMAN: Madam Speaker, the issue that the hon. Member has raised is
definitely very important because Anantapur District is fast becoming a desert.
We do recognize that this District has a difficulty because it has to
industrially and otherwise provide opportunities for its people. But if the
State Government sends us some kind of a proposal, then we may consider it
depending on the Department to which it has to go. So, it is up to the State
Government to take it up. We will certainly work closely with the State
Government on it.
